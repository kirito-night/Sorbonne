INSTALLATION:
-------------
We recommand running LoTREC as a web start from the launch button exisitng on the web site home page (http://www.irit.fr/Lotrec/).
Doing so, you ensure havng the latest updates automatically.

If you still want to use this distribution, all you need to have in order to execute lotrec.jar is the Java Runtime Environement (JRE) 6 (i.e. 1.6) or later.
It can be downloaded from the Sun Java website: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/

Windows plateformes: double click on the lotrec.jar or the run.bat file (or do as follows:)
All plateformes: from your command shell or terminal console, execute the command "java -Xmx512M -jar lotrec.jar"

NOTE:
-----
The command option -Xmx512M allocates 512MBytes RAM to LoTREC. It can be increased till -Xmx1444M.
This is imporatnat if you are debugging or working extensively with LoTREC, specially if you are displaying many graphs during your session. 
Otherwise, LoTREC would run out of memory and should be then restarted.
