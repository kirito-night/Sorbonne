Sugata Mitra is an educator and researcher who conducted an experiment in 1999 in which he placed a computer with internet access in a wall in a slum in New Delhi, India and observed how the children there would use it.

The experiment showed that children, even those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and with little prior exposure to technology, were able to learn and use computers on their own, demonstrating their natural curiosity and ability to learn through self-directed exploration. The results of the experiment challenged the conventional wisdom that children from underprivileged backgrounds require formal education and structured teaching to learn effectively.

Since then, Mitra has continued to explore the concept of self-organized learning and has implemented similar experiments in other parts of the  world. His work has had a significant impact on the field of education  and has inspired new approaches to teaching and learning, especially in  the use of technology.
